/*Envision creating a robust application for a global finance firm that needs to handle and compute multiple currencies with real-time conversion capabilities.
This system is built on a base class called Currency, which contains core data members such as amount, currencyCode, currencySymbol, and an optional exchangeRate.
It provides functions like convertToBase() for converting the amount into a common base currency, convertTo(targetCurrency) for converting between currencies, and
displayCurrency() for showcasing currency details.

Derived classes like Dollar, Euro, and Rupee extend this foundation by introducing currency-specific details and overriding convertToBase() and displayCurrency() to
reflect the exchange rates and regional currency formats dynamically.*/
